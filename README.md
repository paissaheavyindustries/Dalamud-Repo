## How to use this repository (EN/FR/DE/JP)

Please note that if you are playing the CN or KR version of the game, you can't use this repo address! Please scroll lower for your correct regional version.

First, open Dalamud's plugin installer by writing `/xlplugins` ingame, then go to Dalamud settings (bottom of the window), and add this custom repository to the list - it doesn't have to be the first one on the list of course:
